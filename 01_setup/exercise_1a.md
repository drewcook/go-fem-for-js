## Goals

- Familiarize yourself with the golang.org website and resources

## Setup

- Visit `golang.org`

## Directions

Answer the following questions

1. Read about `for loops` in the _Effective Go_ document

- What kind of loop doesnâ€™t exist in Go?

2. Read about the `fmt` _package_

## Answers

1. The `do`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. There is only a simplified `for` loop.
2. `fmt.Println()` returns an `int` number of bytes printed and `error` the error if any write error occurred.
3. Ability to download and authenticate modules via the `go` command.  Improved number literals, modules support, and error wrapping.
